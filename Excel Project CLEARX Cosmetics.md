# CLEARX Cosmetics Sales Optimization Analysis Marketing Report For the Year 2021-2022



CLEARX Cosmetics faces a significant business challenge in effectively monitoring and optimizing its sales performance across its branches. Sales data are collected manually across the two branches, leading to fragmented, error-prone records. Hence, hindering the company's ability to gain insights into product performance, customer preferences, and regional trends. Allocation of resources is inefficient, leading to stockouts or overstock situations thereby tying down profit and also encouraging stealing of excess goods unaccounted for.
